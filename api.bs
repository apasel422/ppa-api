Abstract: This specifies a browser API for the measurement of advertising performance.  The goal is to produce aggregate statistics about how advertising leads to conversions, without creating a risk to the privacy of individual web users.  This API collates information about people from multiple web origins, which could be a significant risk to their privacy.  To manage this risk, the information that is gathered is aggregated using an aggregation service that is chosen by websites and trusted to perform aggregation within strict limits.  Noise is added to the aggregates produced by this service to provide differential privacy.
Status Text: This specification is a proposal that is intended to be migrated to the W3C standards track. It is not a standard.

# Introduction # {#intro}

This document defines a simple API for browsers
that enables the collection of aggregated, differentially-private metrics.

The primary goal of this API is to enable attribution for advertising.


## Attribution ## {#s-attribution}

<dfn lt=attribution|attributed>Attribution</dfn> is the process of identifying [=actions=]
that precede an [=outcome=] of interest,
and allocating value to those [=actions=].

For advertising, <dfn>actions</dfn> that are of interest
are primarily the showing of advertisements
(also referred to as <dfn>impressions</dfn>).
Other actions include ad clicks (or other interactions)
and opportunities to show ads that were not taken.

Desired <dfn>outcomes</dfn> for advertising are more diverse,
as they include any result that an advertiser seeks to improve
through the showing of ads.
A desirable outcome might also be referred to as a <dfn>conversion</dfn>,
which refers to "converting" a potential customer
into a customer.
What counts as a conversion could include
sales, subscriptions, page visits, and enquiries.

For this API, [=actions=] and [=outcomes=] are both
events: things that happen once.
What is unique about attribution for advertising
is that these events might not occur on the same [=site=].
Advertisements are most often shown on sites
other than the advertiser's site.

The primary challenge with attribution is in maintaining privacy.
Attribution involves connecting activity on different sites.
The goal of attribution is to find an impression
that was shown to the same person before the conversion occurred.

If attribution information were directly revealed,
it would enable unwanted
[[PRIVACY-PRINCIPLES#dfn-cross-context-recognition|cross-context recognition]],
thereby enabling [[UNSANCTIONED-TRACKING|tracking]].

This document avoids cross context recognition by ensuring that
attribution information is aggregated using an [=aggregation service=].
The aggregation service is trusted to compute an aggregate
without revealing the values that each person contributes to that aggregate.

Strict limits are placed on the amount of information that each browser instance
contributes to the aggregates for a given site.
Differential privacy is used to provide additional privacy protection for each contribution.

Details of aggregation service operation is included in [[#aggregation]].
The differential privacy design used is outlined in [[#dp]].


## Background ## {#background}

From the early days of the Web,
advertising has been widely used to financially support the creation of sites.

One characteristic that distinguished the Web from other venues for advertising
was the ability to obtain information about the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

Web advertisers were able to measure key metrics like reach (how many people saw an ad),
frequency (how often each person saw an ad),
and [=conversions=] (how many people saw the ad then later took the action that the ad was supposed to motivate).
In comparison, these measurements were far more timely and accurate than for any other medium.

The cost of measurement performance was privacy.
In order to produce accurate and comprehensive information,
advertising businesses performed extensive tracking of the activity of all Web users.
Each browser was given a tracking identifier,
often using cookies that were lodged by cross-site content.
Every action of interest was logged against this identifier,
forming a comprehensive record of a person's online activities.

Having a detailed record of a person's actions allowed advertisers to infer characteristics about people.
Those characteristics made it easier to choose the right audience for advertising,
greatly improving its effectiveness.
This created a strong incentive to gather more information.

Online advertising is intensely competitive.
Sites that show advertising seek to obtain the most money for each ad placement.
Advertisers seek to place advertising where it will have the most effect relative to its cost.
Any competitive edge gained by these entities--
and the intermediaries that operate on their behalf--
depends on having more comprehensive information about a potential audience.

Over time, actions of interest expanded to include nearly every aspects of online activity.
Methods were devised to correlate that information with activity outside of the Web.
An energetic trade has formed,
with multiple purveyors of personal information that is traded for various purposes.


## Goals ## {#goals}

The goal of this document is to define an means of performing attribution
that does not enable tracking.

## Attribution Using Histograms ## {#histograms}

Attribution attempts to measure correlation
between one or more ad placements ([=impressions=])
and the [=outcomes=] that an advertiser desires.

When considered in the aggregate,
information about individuals is not useful.
Actions and outcomes need to be grouped.

The simplest form of attribution splits impressions into a number of groupings
according to the attributes of the advertisement
and counts the number of conversions.
Groupings might be formed from attributes such as
where the ad is shown,
what was shown (the "creative"),
when the ad was shown,
or to whom.

These groupings
and the tallies of conversions attributed to each
form a histogram.
Each bucket of the histogram counts the conversions
for a group of ads.

<figcaption>Sample histogram for conversion counts,
  grouped by the site where the impressions were shown</figcaption>
</figure>

Different groupings might be used for different purposes.
For instance, grouping by creative (the content of an ad)
might be used to learn which creative works best.

Adding a value greater than one at each conversion
enables more than simple counts.
Histograms can also aggregate values,
which might be used to differentiate between different outcomes.
A higher value might be used for larger purchases
or any outcome that is more highly-valued.
A conversion value might also be split between multiple impressions
to split credit,
though this capability is not presently supported in the API.


# Overview of Operation # {#overview}

At impression time, information about an advertisement is saved by the browser in a write-only store.
This includes an identifier for the ad and some metadata about the ad,
such as whether the impression was an ad view or an ad click.

At conversion time, information for aggregation is created based on the impressions that were previously stored.
A site can request that the browser select impressions based on a simple query.

*   If there was no matching impression,
    or the [=privacy budget=] for the site is exhausted,
    a histogram consisting entirely of zeros (0) is constructed.

*   If a matching impression is found,
    the specified value is added to a histogram
    at the bucket that was specified for the ad at the time of the impression.
    All other buckets are set to zero.

The resulting histogram is prepared for aggregation according to the requirements
of the chosen [=aggregation service=] and returned to the site.
This minimally involves encryption of the histogram.

<p class=note>A site that invokes this API will always receive a valid conversion report.
As a result, sites learn nothing about what happened on other sites from this interaction.

The site can collect the encrypted histograms it receives from calls to this API
and submit them to the aggregation service.

The aggregation service:

1.  confirms that it has not
    previously computed an aggregate
    from the provided inputs
    and that there are enough conversion reports,

2.  adds the histograms including sufficient [[#dp noise]]
    to produce a differentially-private aggregate histogram, and

3.  returns the aggregate to the site.

# Aggregation # {#aggregation}

An <dfn>aggregation service</dfn> takes multiple pieces of attribution information
and produces an aggregate metric.

Each browser will have different requirements for aggregation.

This design uses the concept of differential privacy as the basis of its privacy design.


## Privacy Budgets ## {#dp-budget}

Browsers maintain a <dfn>privacy budget</dfn>,
which is a means of limiting the amount of privacy loss.
